## My humble attempt at writing a basic Machine Learning Library

This is an ongoing Machine Learning library. I'm coding this for fun and for my own educational purposes! The plan is to implemement several simple components for neural networks, naive bayes classifiers, SVMs, etc, following various resources, and eventually moving on to more advanced techniques.
